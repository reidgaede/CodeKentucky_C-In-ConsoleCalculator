# CodeKentucky_C-In-ConsoleCalculator

Project completed as "Knowledge Check" at conclusion of Module 1 within Code Kentucky's/Code:You's Software Development Pathway.

Project guidelines requested that we simply implement the calculator's multiplication functionality, but I implemented a rudimentary `while`-loop to re-solicit user input even after a computation was completed (this calculator app, as originally designed, terminated as soon as an addition/subtraction/multiplication/division operation was completed or an invalid input was received).

Original source code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/JakeSaintG/Software1-Knowledge-Check-1/tree/main).
